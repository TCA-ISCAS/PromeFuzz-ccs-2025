## Related source code

Part of the ffjpeg library that is relevant to the crash is as follows:

- `mbitstr_close`:
```c
static int mbitstr_close(void *stream)
{
    MBITSTR *context = (MBITSTR*)stream;
    if (!context) return EOF;
    free(context);
    return 0;
}
```

- `bitstr_close`:
```c
int bitstr_close(void *stream)
{
    int type;
    if (!stream) return EOF;
    type = *(int*)stream;
    switch (type) {
    case BITSTR_MEM : return mbitstr_close(stream);
    case BITSTR_FILE: return fbitstr_close(stream);
    }
    return EOF;
}
```

# Analysis from LLM

The crash is a Misuse in fuzz driver, below is the explanation.

The crash occurs due to a **double-free** in the fuzz driver. The root cause is that the `bitstr_close(stream)` call in the fuzz driver (which internally calls `mbitstr_close`) already frees the `stream` pointer, but the fuzz driver explicitly calls `free(stream)` again afterward. This violates the ownership rules of the ffjpeg library:

1. The library's `mbitstr_close` explicitly frees the stream pointer (`free(context)`), implying that the library takes ownership of memory management for streams created through its APIs.
2. The fuzz driver incorrectly assumes manual control of the stream's memory by:
   - Allocating `stream` via `malloc(1024)`
   - Calling `bitstr_close` (which frees the pointer)
   - Then explicitly calling `free(stream)` again

This constitutes a classic double-free scenario. The library is functioning as designed - streams created through proper library interfaces would be allocated/freed internally, but the fuzz driver misuses the API by:
- Creating a raw memory buffer instead of using proper stream creation APIs
- Failing to recognize that `bitstr_close` already handles memory deallocation

The crash is caused by API misuse in the fuzz driver, not a library bug. Proper usage would require either:
1. Using library-provided stream creation functions (not shown in provided code), or
2. Not calling `free(stream)` after `bitstr_close` if manually allocating the stream

# Reasoning Process

Okay, let's try to figure out why this crash is happening. The crash report mentions a double-free detected by AddressSanitizer. The backtrace shows that free is called twice on the same pointer. The first free happens in mbitstr_close, which is called by bitstr_close, and then again in the fuzz driver's free(stream). 

Looking at the fuzz driver code: the user allocates 1024 bytes for stream using malloc. Then they call bitstr_close(stream), which according to the library code, in the case of BITSTR_MEM, calls mbitstr_close. Inside mbitstr_close, they free the context, which is the same as the stream pointer. So after bitstr_close is called, the stream pointer has already been freed. But then the fuzz driver calls free(stream) again, leading to a double-free.

Wait, but why does the stream pointer get freed by mbitstr_close? The stream is allocated as a void* in the driver. The library's mbitstr_close is expecting a MBITSTR* context. If the stream was initialized properly as a MBITSTR structure, then maybe the free is correct. But in the fuzz driver, the user just allocates 1024 bytes and copies data into it. Then they pass this to bitstr functions. However, the bitstr functions, especially the close function, expect that the stream was created by the library's own functions, not a random malloc. 

The problem here is that the fuzz driver is creating a stream by manually allocating memory and initializing it with arbitrary data. The bitstr_close function treats the stream as a BITSTR_MEM type (since the first bytes of the allocated memory might coincidentally represent the BITSTR_MEM type). Then mbitstr_close frees the context (i.e., the stream pointer). Later, the driver calls free(stream) again, leading to a double-free. 

So the root cause is that the fuzz driver is misusing the library. The library's bitstr_close is designed to free the stream memory when handling a BITSTR_MEM type, but the driver is not supposed to manage the allocation of the stream pointer in this case. The correct usage would be to create the stream using the library's functions (like mbitstr_open or similar), which would properly initialize the structure, including the type field. The driver is instead creating a raw buffer and passing it to bitstr_close, which then frees it. Then the driver frees it again, causing the crash.

Therefore, the crash is due to a misuse in the fuzz driver, not a bug in the library. The library functions are behaving as intended, assuming that the stream was properly initialized by the library's own functions. The driver is creating a stream incorrectly, leading to the double-free.
