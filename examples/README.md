# Example Fuzzing Harnesses and Crash Reports

This directory provides **examples** of fuzzing harnesses and crash reports generated by **PromeFuzz**, organized by target library.

Each library subdirectory contains the following components:

### 📁 `synthesized/`
Contains the **automatically generated fuzzing harnesses** produced by PromeFuzz.  
- Harnesses are named numerically (e.g., `0.c`, `1.cpp`).  
- The main entry point is labeled `entry.c` or `entry.cpp`.

### 🛠️ Build Scripts
A set of standardized scripts to compile the synthesized harnesses with different fuzzing and coverage backends:

| Script | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `build_synthesized_driver.sh` | Builds the harness using **LibFuzzer** (default). |
| `build_aflpp_synthesized_driver.sh` | Builds the harness for **AFL++** compatibility. |
| `build_gcov_synthesized_driver.sh` | Builds with **GCC instrumentation** for `gcov`-based coverage. |
| `build_cov_synthesized_driver.sh` | Builds with **Clang instrumentation** for `llvm-cov`-based coverage. |

These scripts automate compiler flags and linking requirements, ensuring consistent builds across environments.

### 📁 `report/`
Contains **sample crash reports** in Markdown format, generated during fuzzing and analyzed by PromeFuzz’s crash analyzer.
