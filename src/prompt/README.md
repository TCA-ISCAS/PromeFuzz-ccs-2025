All prompt templates are stored in this directory. Each prompt template is a markdown file that contains the format string for the prompt. The format string is a string that contains placeholders for the various components of the prompt. The placeholders are replaced with the actual values when the prompt is rendered.

They are categorized into three types by their suffixes:

- `.sys`: System prompt templates
- `.usr`: User prompt templates
- `.sub`: Sub templates inside the user prompt templates
